# Monte Carlo Simulations for Risk Assessments
This code has been used in support of my MSc thesis in the Royal Holloway, University of London, Information Security Program.

## How to run
Define a simulation run for likelihood and impact, example in a quantitative risk assessment with a 5x5 risk matrix:
likelihood_min, likelihood_max = 2, 5
impact_min, impact_max = 2, 5

The example above allows to run a simulation where likelhood will not fall below 2 and max not higher then 5. Meaning there is some level of variability through the risk spectrum.
